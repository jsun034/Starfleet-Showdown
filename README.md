# Starfleet-Showdown
Created my Joshua Sun(me), Andrew Yuan, Gabriel Gomez, and Brett McCausland

## Overview
Starfleet Showdown is a space-themed aerial dog-fighting simulator where you and up to 3 other friends fly spaceships through Space and try to shoot each other out of the cosmos. The objective of the game is to be the last spaceship alive. Players navigate through a dynamic environment filled with asteroids and large capital ships. Once players find each other, they can eliminate each other using their spaceshipâ€™s lasers. By default, player 1 is controlled by keyboard and mouse. Players 2-4 are controlled by Xbox controllers.
* 1-player mode fights AI
* 2-4 player mode is PVP.
